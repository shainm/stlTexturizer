# BumpMesh by CNC Kitchen

**Live:** https://bumpmesh.com  
**GitHub:** https://github.com/CNCKitchen/stlTexturizer
**Author:** Stefan Hermann

A browser-based tool for applying surface displacement textures to 3D meshes — no installation required.

Load an STL, OBJ, 3MF, or STEP file, pick a texture, tune the parameters, and export a new displaced STL ready for slicing.

## Recent Updates

- Roughly 2× more triangles for the same memory — pipeline peak cut from ~660 to ~330 bytes per subdivided triangle, with bit-identical output
- STEP import (`.step` / `.stp`) via [meshStep](https://github.com/CNCKitchen/meshStep)
- Save / load project files (`.bumpmesh`)
- Undo / redo history
- Part rotation gizmo
- Mesh diagnostics
- Smooth masking borders with selectable transition curves (linear, S-curve, ease-in)
- New languages: Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Japanese, French
- 2–3× speed improvement
- 3MF export
- Mouse-wheel fine tuning of values
- Quality of life improvements

## Features

### Textures
- **96 built-in seamless textures** in seven categories (geometric, patterns, organic, fabric, natural, grip, molded): weaves, knurling, carbon twill, chainmail, scales, bark, wood grain, cobblestone, Japandi flutes and ripples, mold grains (sand matte, VDI spark erosion, leather, haircell), Hero Patterns and more
- **Texture Gallery** — browse, search and filter the full catalogue in a side panel that takes the settings sidebar's place and stays open while you try textures on the model (click or arrow keys; the model spins on a turntable while you browse); star favorites to pin them in the panel grid, which grows by a row per 4 (saved in the browser)
- **Custom textures** — upload your own image as a displacement map, or an ideaMaker `.texture` file; uploads are kept under "Your textures" in the gallery (this browser only, and the browser may clear them at any time) where you can star, re-download or delete them
- **Texture smoothing** — configurable blur to soften the displacement map before applying

### Projection Modes
- **Triplanar** (default) — blends three planar projections based on surface normals; best for complex shapes
- **Cubic (Box)** — projects from 6 box faces with edge-seam blending and smart axis dominance
- **Cylindrical** — wraps texture around a cylindrical axis with configurable cap angle
- **Spherical** — maps texture spherically around the object
- **Planar XY / XZ / YZ** — flat axis-aligned projections

### UV & Transform Controls
- **Scale U/V** — independent or locked scaling (0.05–10×, logarithmic)
- **Offset U/V** — position the texture on each axis
- **Rotation** — rotate texture before projection
- **Seam Blend Strength** — softens hard edges where Cubic/Cylindrical projection faces meet
- **Seam Band Width** — controls blending zone width at seam edges
- **Cap Angle** (Cylindrical) — threshold for switching to top/bottom cap projection

### Displacement
- **Amplitude** — scales displacement depth from 0 % to 100 %
- **Symmetric displacement** — 50 % grey stays neutral, white pushes out, black pushes in (preserves volume)
- **3D displacement preview** — real-time GPU-accelerated preview toggle showing actual vertex displacement
- **Amplitude overlap warning** — alerts when depth exceeds 10 % of the smallest model dimension

### Texture Layers
- **Several textures on one model** — up to four layers, each with its own texture, projection, size, height and painted surface; the sidebar always edits the highlighted layer, whose surfaces show in teal while everything else is grey
- **Cover or add** — a layer covers the layers below where it is painted, or adds its relief to them
- **New layers start empty** in Include Only mode with the fill tool ready: click the surfaces the texture should cover
- Layers, their paint and their textures are saved in `.bumpmesh` projects; **Bake Textures** flattens them into the mesh when needed

### Surface Masking
- **Angle masking** — suppress texture on near-horizontal top and/or bottom faces (0°–90° threshold each)
- **Surface painting** — paint surfaces to exclude (orange) or exclusively include them
  - Circle brush, **Precision** mode (default) — refines the mesh under the stroke itself (after PrusaSlicer's paint-on tool), so the stroke edge is as fine on a 12-triangle cube as on a scan; the base mesh is never modified
  - Circle brush, **Standard** mode — marks every whole triangle the brush touches (highlighted while hovering), so a quick smudge selects the flat faces of a CAD model
  - Hardness (Precision) — a soft brush fades the mask out toward the rim for gradual texture borders
  - Single-triangle brush and bucket fill — flood-fills adjacent faces up to a configurable dihedral-angle threshold
  - Erase — hold Shift to undo painted surfaces
  - Clear all — reset the layer's paint

### Mesh Processing
- **Adaptive subdivision** — subdivides edges until they are ≤ a target length; respects sharp creases (>30° dihedral)
- **QEM decimation** — simplifies the result to a target triangle count using Quadric Error Metrics with boundary protection, link-condition checks, normal-flip rejection, and crease preservation
- **Mesh diagnostics** — automatic checks for open edges and shell count, with advanced diagnostics and overlay highlights for problem areas
- **Safety cap** — hard limit of 10 M triangles during subdivision to prevent out-of-memory

### 3D Viewer
- **Orbit / pan / zoom** controls
- **3Dconnexion SpaceMouse** — fly the view with the puck in Chrome and Edge: push/pull to zoom, slide to pan, tilt and twist to orbit (connects after the first touch of the puck)
- **Wireframe toggle** — visualise mesh topology
- **Section view** — cut the model open with a plane to see which inner surfaces (holes, cavities, the inside of hollow parts) get textured, and mask them right through the cut; X/Y/Z snap, flip, and drag handles to move or tilt the cut
- **Mesh info** — live triangle count, file size, bounding-box dimensions
- **Grid & axes indicator** — X = red, Y = green, Z = blue
- **Place on Face** — click a face to orient it downward onto the print bed

### File Support
- **.STL** — binary and ASCII
- **.OBJ** — via Three.js OBJLoader
- **.3MF** — ZIP-based format (via fflate decompression)
- **.STEP / .STP** — CAD B-rep files, tessellated in-browser by [meshStep](https://github.com/CNCKitchen/meshStep) with coarse / standard / fine quality presets

### Export
- Downloads a **binary STL** with displacement baked in
- Progress reporting through subdivision → displacement → decimation → writing stages
- Configurable edge-length threshold and output triangle limit

### Other
- **Light / Dark theme** — respects OS preference, persisted per browser
- **Multilingual** — English and German UI with auto-detection

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in a modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari).
2. Drop a model onto the viewport or click **Load STL…** (supports STL, OBJ, 3MF).
3. Select a texture preset from the sidebar (or upload a custom image).
4. Choose a projection mode and adjust UV scale, offset, rotation, and amplitude.
5. Optionally mask or exclude surfaces with the angle sliders or paint tools.
6. Click **Export STL** to download the displaced mesh.

> **Note:** All processing runs entirely in the browser — no data is uploaded to any server.

## Run Locally

All processing runs entirely in the browser — no backend or build step is needed. You just need a local HTTP server because browsers block ES module imports and texture loading from `file://` URLs.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/CNCKitchen/stlTexturizer.git
cd stlTexturizer
```

Then start any static file server from the project root. Pick whichever you have installed:

**Python (3.x)**
```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

**Python (2.x)**
```bash
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
```

**Node.js (npx, no install needed)**
```bash
npx serve .
```

**PHP**
```bash
php -S localhost:8000
```

Open http://localhost:8000 in your browser and you're ready to go.

> **Tip:** Any static server will work — the app has no server-side dependencies. After updating a local copy, hard-reload once (Ctrl+F5 / Cmd+Shift+R): most simple servers don't send cache headers, so the browser may otherwise mix new and old files.

**Docker / Podman**
```bash
docker compose up -d      # or: podman-compose -f podman-compose.yaml up -d
```
Serves the app on http://localhost:8080. To change the port or container name, copy `.env.example` to `.env` and edit it.
